 * Mockingbird Electric - Static Site Entry Point
 * 
 * As per the request for a pure static site with no React/TypeScript overhead, 
 * all UI and logic have been moved directly into index.html.
 * 
 * This file remains as a placeholder to satisfy the environment's entry point 
 * requirements without executing any mounting logic that would cause errors.
